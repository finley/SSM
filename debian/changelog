  * fab4d35 - Ensure we avoid double-running of pre and post scripts in
    the future   for all other functions that invoke them using the same
    method as with   remove_file().
  * 8b12d2c - Fix double-running of pre and post scripts.  Root cause
    was that   remove_file() was being re-used in many other functions,
    but also   works as a standalone function that _should_ run it's own
    post   scripts.  We now make sure that it only invokes pre/post
    scripts if it   is being called by the take_file_action()
    subroutine, which means it's   the _primary_ function, and not just
    a _supporting_ function.
  * abe23b3 - Convert hard link routines to use the new style

    Roskow.  Good   suggestion, Marc!
  * 5db2f38 - Document package repo options in sample conf file - Remove
    package repo options from command line (for now at least)

    updates if last update over 24hours ago     - 24 is variablized and

  * ssm: Don't loop if --no
  * YUM: do workaround to handle stoopid rpm inconsistency ->
    gpg-pubkey.(none) non-package
  * YUM: fix modify get_pkgs_currently_installed to address yum fixed length
    output issue -- was truncating certain long package names

  * RPM: make rpm 'noarch'.
  * Makefile: upload RPMs to download site too.

 -- Brian Elliott Finley <brian@thefinleys.com>  Tue, 28 Oct 2008 16:03:37 -0500

ssm (0.4.15-1) hardy; urgency=low

  * RPM: Include spec file and build RPM as part of 'make release'
  * Fix package handling under --yes and --no options: raise error level,
    print appropriate message
  * Yum: Don't use yum cache option (-C) for install_pkgs and upgrade_pkgs.
    It can cause failure if a prior invokation of yum was killed with packages
    or data half-downloaded.
  * Yum: Include 'set to be updated' packages as yum identified dependencies,
    as they are sometimes not actually installed yet.

 -- Brian Elliott Finley <brian@thefinleys.com>  Tue, 28 Oct 2008 15:56:56 -0500

ssm (0.4.14-1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Add explanations and tips for how to resolve dependencies.
  * Support for package manager "yum".
  * Support for package manager "none".  Such as for Solaris, or
    XenServer5 hypervisors.
  * Each package manager now has it's own module, which all have the same
    API, exporting the same functions to the ssm program.
  * Use pure perl for downloading files with http.  Continue to use wget
    for https and ftp.  Can add those too in the future, but adding http
    support was really stinkin' easy.
  * Example file: include "HOWTO Get Your Initial Package List" HOWTOs
  * Add framework for an rpm spec file
  * Declare pkg_manager in output
  * Remove --check-in option (unused) 
  * Additional debug statements when entering certain subroutines.

ssm (0.4.13-1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Change $o{no} to $o{answer_no} for clarity.
  * Remove --dry-run option, in favor of --no; And change $o{dry_run} to
    $o{answer_no} accordingly.
  * Improve output for automated runs (--no or --yes) so that all questions
    are asked even if answer is automatic.
  * Remove --quiet option.  Code is now simpler, it's unclear how useful it
    would be, and output can still be redirected to /dev/null if needed.
  * Align output so that it's easier to see that state and action identifiers:
    OK, Not OK, WARNING, FIXING, RUNNING.
  * Makefile: include code to auto-upload to Linus
  * Examples: one-of-each.conf: ensure safely runnable

ssm (0.4.12-1) hardy; urgency=low

  Key improvements and visible changes:
  * Add "ignored" file type.  Simply ignores said file.

    [file]
    type = unwanted
    name = /tmp/hosts

  * enable logging to /var/log/ssm via the ssm_print function
  * logs are rotated via the rotate_log_file function
  * updated examples file; improved verbiage
  * Stop adding the $file.README file so SVN when adding a $file.
  * Clean up output by removing unnecessary blank lines, etc.
  * Improve the sample config snippet when adding a file.
  
  Minor changes:
  * don't put a blank line in output between bundles and files
  * use more explicit variable name: $o{file_to_add} to avoid potential future
    conflicts.
  * Modify add_file_to_repo function to handle ssm_print().
  * Modify library to invoke add_file_to_repo directly, instead of invoking
    ssm_add-file as a separate command.
  * fix a little ssm_print bug -- cant use it everywhere
  * identify timestamp in logfile with TIMESTAMP indicator

ssm (0.4.11-1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Fix bug: unwanted files that are symlinks with no target weren't
    getting removed.

  * Test for config file error where [stanza] is declared, but isn't properly
    delimited.  Ie.: the second [file] below would produce the error we're
    testing for.  To correct, it should simply be omitted:

    [file]
    comment = my test file
    [file]
    comment = more valid comments
    type = symlink
    name = /tmp/hosts
    target = /etc/hosts

  * do get_pkgs_to_be_removed for yum; annotate get_deb_pkg_provides.

  * add placeholder for get_rpm_pkgs_that_need_to_be_upgraded()

  * Print clean error if local file (needed for copy) doesn't exist

  * Add --no option

  * Include --dry-run in help output; Add --no option

  * add first bits of yum compatibility; allow pkg_manager = none, or commented out.

ssm (0.4.10-1) hardy; urgency=low

  * allow relative or absolute soflink targets -- take what user specifies
  * print WARNING: if softlink target doesn't exist
  * when installing new file, rm old file first
  * use system's "rm" command, instead of File::Path's "rmtree" function,
    to remove files -- it's safer under certain circumstances.

 -- Brian Elliott Finley <brian@thefinleys.com>  Mon, 07 Apr 2008 15:14:33 -0500

ssm (0.4.9-1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Found and fixed bug: If a link or link target was specified with trailing
    spaces, those trailing spaces were considered part of the filename.
    Technically it's possible to have trailing spaces in a filename, but for
    this tool, we're going to assume they're in the defninition file on
    accident.  We do still handle files with spaces in the middle.

ssm (0.4.8-1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    * add the rotate_log() function.
    * Check for defined variables before testing them, when validating
      directory definitions.  Really.  It's fixed this time.  Well, for
      do_directory() at least.  Rios will come back in later and apply the
      same fix to the other subroutines. -BEF-
    * Check for defined variables before testing them, when validating
      directory definitions

        dependencies satisfied later in the process.
