  * When "Need to fix ownership and permissions" is displayed, also
    show the existing and target permissions for the file.
  * When doing a "diff", also diff_ownership_and_permissions().
  * Fix a couple of places where svn was being called without the
    --no-auth-cache option.  All svn calls should now be made using the
     $svn variable. SVN v1.6 will allow for secure on-disk caching of the
     password.  At that point, we can consider removal of this option.
  * Added show_diff_comments() function.
    * Only do for relevant file types (!generated)
  * Added a "c" for "comments" option to [N/y/d/a].  It now looks like

  * Fix package handling under --yes and --no options: raise error level,
    print appropriate message
  * Yum: Don't use yum cache option (-C) for install_pkgs and upgrade_pkgs.
    It can cause failure if a prior invokation of yum was killed with packages
    or data half-downloaded.
  * Yum: Include 'set to be updated' packages as yum identified dependencies,
    as they are sometimes not actually installed yet.

 -- Brian Elliott Finley <brian@thefinleys.com>  Tue, 28 Oct 2008 15:56:56 -0500

ssm (0.4.14-1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Add explanations and tips for how to resolve dependencies.
  * Support for package manager "yum".
  * Support for package manager "none".  Such as for Solaris, or
    XenServer5 hypervisors.
  * Each package manager now has it's own module, which all have the same
    API, exporting the same functions to the ssm program.
  * Use pure perl for downloading files with http.  Continue to use wget
    for https and ftp.  Can add those too in the future, but adding http
    support was really stinkin' easy.
  * Example file: include "HOWTO Get Your Initial Package List" HOWTOs
  * Add framework for an rpm spec file
  * Declare pkg_manager in output
  * Remove --check-in option (unused) 
  * Additional debug statements when entering certain subroutines.

    $o{answer_no} accordingly.
  * Improve output for automated runs (--no or --yes) so that all questions
    are asked even if answer is automatic.
  * Remove --quiet option.  Code is now simpler, it's unclear how useful it
    would be, and output can still be redirected to /dev/null if needed.
  * Align output so that it's easier to see that state and action identifiers:
    OK, Not OK, WARNING, FIXING, RUNNING.
  * Makefile: include code to auto-upload to Linus
  * Examples: one-of-each.conf: ensure safely runnable

ssm (0.4.12-1) hardy; urgency=low

  Key improvements and visible changes:
  * Add "ignored" file type.  Simply ignores said file.

  * enable logging to /var/log/ssm via the ssm_print function
  * logs are rotated via the rotate_log_file function
  * updated examples file; improved verbiage
  * Stop adding the $file.README file so SVN when adding a $file.
  * Clean up output by removing unnecessary blank lines, etc.
  * Improve the sample config snippet when adding a file.
  
  Minor changes:
  * don't put a blank line in output between bundles and files
  * use more explicit variable name: $o{file_to_add} to avoid potential future
    conflicts.
  * Modify add_file_to_repo function to handle ssm_print().
  * Modify library to invoke add_file_to_repo directly, instead of invoking
    ssm_add-file as a separate command.
  * fix a little ssm_print bug -- cant use it everywhere
  * identify timestamp in logfile with TIMESTAMP indicator

ssm (0.4.11-1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Fix bug: unwanted files that are symlinks with no target weren't
    getting removed.

  * Test for config file error where [stanza] is declared, but isn't properly
    delimited.  Ie.: the second [file] below would produce the error we're
    testing for.  To correct, it should simply be omitted:

    [file]
    comment = my test file
    [file]
    comment = more valid comments
    type = symlink
    name = /tmp/hosts
    target = /etc/hosts

  * do get_pkgs_to_be_removed for yum; annotate get_deb_pkg_provides.

  * add placeholder for get_rpm_pkgs_that_need_to_be_upgraded()

  * Print clean error if local file (needed for copy) doesn't exist

  * Add --no option

  * Include --dry-run in help output; Add --no option

    spaces, those trailing spaces were considered part of the filename.
    Technically it's possible to have trailing spaces in a filename, but for

  * Fix spaces between bundle names in display.  Again.
  * If base_uri is not set in the definition file, then do a dirname on the
    location of the definition file (from the client.conf file) and use that
    as base_uri.

ssm (0.1.153-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Checks to see if a newer package of itself is available before taking any
    other actions.  If one is, then it installs that package, and re-starts
    with the new binary.  This only works for package based installs for now
    (Ie.: Ubuntu and Debian, but not Red Hat).
  * Shows the names of included bundles, in addition to the client's state
    definition file.
