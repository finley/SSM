#   Simple State Manager
#
#   Simple State Manager is a tool that can be used to ensure consistent
#   state across a large number of machines.  
#
#   Simple State Manager includes the following features, plus others:
#
#       Designed to be "safe" above all, and not do anything
#       "automatically", but to ask for your permission in all cases
#       (unless you tell it not to with "--yes").
#
#       Designed to use a simple, easy to read configuration file.
#
#       State definition config files support "includes" (called
#       bundles).
#
#       State definition files may be located on a managed node's local
#       file system, a shared file system, or on a central web or ftp
#       server.
#
#       Supports priorities (this version of file X has priority over
#       that version of file X)
#
#       Handles files and packages
#
#       Handles the following file types (and others):
#           - regular
#           - directory
#           - softlink
#           - hardlink
#           - block
#           - character
#           - fifo
#
#   This file is a heavily commented example state definition config
#   file.
#
#   It is intended to be used as a canonical reference of all possible
#   Simple State Manager definition options.  It should contain at least
#   one of each type of configuration entry.
#
#   It is also designed to be used (unmodified) as a safe demonstration
#   of Simple State Manager file based functionality.
#
#   Give it a try with the safe example config file!
#
#   This safe config file does no package operations, and only
#   references demo files that live in /tmp/.
#
#   ssm --summary --config /usr/share/doc/simple-state-manager/examples/safe_to_run_example_config_file.conf
#
#       Just show a summary of the current state of things.  This is a
#       safe and read only operation.
#
#   ssm --sync    --config /usr/share/doc/simple-state-manager/examples/safe_to_run_example_config_file.conf
#
#       One by one, shows each item that is "out of sync", and asks you
#       to choose to do nothing (the default), or one of a handful of
#       other options.  Again, this is safe, and won't even make any
#       changes to the demo files without your permission.

#
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Package Manager
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#       apt-get      
#           Appropriate for Ubuntu, Debian, and Debian based systems.
#           dpkg and aptitude may be used as synonyms for apt-get.
#
#       yum
#           Appropriate for RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Scientific Linux, and
#           other RPM+YUM based systems.
#    
#       zypper
#           Appropriate for SLE, OpenSUSE, and any zypper based system.
#    
#       none
#           Use type 'none' for AIX and other non-Linux, Unix-like
#           systems, not-yet supported package managers, or if you
#           simply don't want to incorporate package management.
#
#       Default: none
# 
#pkg_manager = none
#
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Package Manager Autoremove
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#       yes
#           If your package manager supports an autoremove option, ssm
#           will present you with an option to remove packages
#           identified for autoremoval.
#
#           If you've ever had the /boot file system fill up with old
#           kernel files, you want to enable this option.  For details
#           on the behavior to expect see the man page for your package
#           manager.
#
#       no
#           Don't autoremove packages.
#    
#       Default: no  (but 'yes' is highly recommended)
# 
#pkg_manager_autoremove = no
#
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Package Repo Updates
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#       auto
#           Ask the package manager to update it's package repo info
#           cache, but only if the last update happened over
#           $pkg_repo_update_window hours ago.
#
#       yes
#           Ask the package manager to update it's package repo info
#           cache, every time.
#
#       no
#           Never ask the package manager to update it's package repo
#           info cache.
#
#       Default: auto
# 
#pkg_repo_update = auto
#
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Package Repo Update Window
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   When 'pkg_repo_update' is set to 'auto' (see above), wait this many
#   hours before doing an update of the cached package repo data.
#
#   Skipping unnecessary package repo updates can have a dramatic
#   positive impact on performance of this tool.
#
#   Defaults to '12' (number of hours)
#
#
#pkg_repo_update_window = 12
#
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Package Specification Style
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#       minimalist 
#           Only specify the packages you know you need.  Dependencies
#           will automatically be installed.  No packages will be
#           removed unless explicitly specified with a 'pkgname =
#           unwanted'.
#   
#       explicit
#           With 'explicit', you must provide a complete and exact list
#           of packages required.  Any existing packages that are not in
#           the list will be removed.  
#       
#           This option is NOT recommended.  It requires more effort to
#           maintain, especially when package names pulled in by the
#           package manager as dependencies change over time.
#
#       Default: minimalist
#
#pkg_specification_style = minimalist
#
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Remove the Running Kernel?
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   If set to yes, go ahead and remove the running kernel if it's
#   package is identified for removal based on package definitions.
#   Removing the running kernel can be dangerous, so this setting
#   defaults to no.  This should not cause a problem, as the typical
#   reason for removing one kernel package is that a newer one (or two)
#   has been put in place.  So the next time you reboot, it should be
#   safely removed even if you leave this set to "no".
#
#       Default: minimalist
#
#remove_running_kernel = no

#   Base URL
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   Base URL allows you to specify the location of your Simple State
#   Manager repository.  Your Simple State Manager repo is where Simple
#   State Manager will look for the canonical version of any files you
#   define.  It will also be pre-pended to the name of any bundle files
#   that you reference, unless they are specified with a fully qualified
#   file name.
#
#   Base URL doesn't usually need to be set, as it defaults to the
#   location where the config_file sits, and standard practice is to
#   keep definition files in your Simple State Manager repo.
#
#base_url   http://server/OU/FQDN
#base_url   https://server/OU/FQDN

#   Upload URL
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   upload_url is used by Simple State Manager when adding new files or
#   new versions of files to your repo.  You'll probably want to have
#   some kind of passwordless authentication mechanism in place when
#   using SSH based URLs.
#
#   Defaults to base_url if using a file:// style URL.

#
#   Each file section allows you to define a desired state for the named
#   file, which includes a variety of critical characterstics that are
#   appropriate based on the type of file.
#
#   File 'type' can be one of:
#       regular
#       directory
#       softlink
#       hardlink
#       block
#       character
#       fifo

#       depends = /file /directory pkgname1 pkgname2
#
#           * List of packages and/or files which must be installed prior to 
#             taking action on this configuration element.
#           * This is a white space seperated list.
#           * If a list item starts with a slash (/), then it is treated as a
#             file or directory.
#           * If a list item starts with anything other than a slash, it is
#             treated as a package name.
#
#       priority = 0
#           
#           * More than one entry for the same file can be specified.
#             The entry with the higher priority wins.  Allows a machine
#             specific config to override a common config, for example.
#           * Should be a positive or negative integer.
#           * If no priority specified, value defaults to 0.
#
#       prescript = /some/command
#
#           * The prescript is executed verbatim before taking other
#             action on the "name"ed file or directory.
#
#       postscript = /some/command
#
#           * The postscript is executed verbatim after taking other
#             action on the "name"ed file or directory.
#


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# "regular"
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   A regular file.  A normal plain old file.  Not a symlink, directory,
#   fifo, etc.
#
#   Regular files have their md5sum, ownership, and permissions
#   verified.  
#   * If the md5sum doesn't match, the golden file from the $base_uri
#     is installed, and permissions are set.
#   * If the md5sum matches, but the permissions are wrong, then only
#     the permissions are fixed.
#   * Priority not specified, so zero (0) is implied.

group = root
mode = 0644

#   Another regular file (same file as above, but perhaps in a bundle,
#   with higher priority).
#
#   * Highest priority wins.
#   * No numerical limit.
#   * Use an integer.
#   * If you don't use an integer, the string length of the value you
#     provide will be used as the integer value.  A value of 'one' would
#     result in an integer value of '3' (3 characters in the word 'one').

#   Same as a directory, but remove any contents that are not elsewhere
#   in the definition.
#
#   * Create directory and maintain permissions and ownership on the 
#     directory, just like a simple "type = directory".
#   * Plus, any contents of this directory that are not defined 
#     (elsewhere in the configuration) will be marked as unwanted.

#         auto-skipped, and $ERROR_LEVEL (which is used as the exit
#         status) is incremented.
#   * If a hardlink exists, the inode of the link and target are
#     compared: 
#       * If they match, nothing is done.

# "generated"
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   A file that is generated via a generator that is any series of
#   commands that can be run from the shell.  The resultant file is
#   literally what you get if you "scrape-n-paste" the commands
#   specified as the "generator".
#
#   A generator may extend across multiple lines.  Yes, you can even
#   paste in an entire shell script or a full perl or python program
#   (for example) as your generator.
#
#   A single line generator takes the form of:
#
#       generator = single line list of commands to run
#
#   A multi-line generator takes the form of a HERE_DOCUMENT.  
#
#       generator = <<EOF
#       some commands
#       more commands
#       more commands
#       etc.
#       EOF
#
#   The HERE_TERMINATOR can be anything you like, but any unquoted
#   leading or trailing spaces will be ignored.  Therefore, the
#   following are equivalent:
#   
#       generator = <<EOF
#       generator = << EOF
#       generator = << 'EOF'
#       generator = << "EOF"
#       generator = <<      "EOF"

#     operation, as the "generator" is run every single time the file 
#     is tested.

#     * If any rc directory contains a file with a name that matches 
#       (link or not -- some apps install copies instead of links), but
#       is not defined, it will be removed.
#     * Any defined links will be created.
#   * Order of entry of details does not matter.
#
# depends (optional):
#   * List of packages and/or files which must be installed prior to 
#     taking action on this configuration element.
#   * This is a white space seperated list.
#   * If a list item starts with a slash (/), then it is treated as a
#     file or directory.
#   * If a list item starts with anything other than a slash, it is
#     treated as a package name.
#
# Note: a "name that matches" means a filename that starts with either
#       an upper case S or K, followed by two digits, followed by the
#       name of the init script in question.
#
# This example will create the following links, and will remove all
# others from the /etc/rc?.d directories:
#
#   /etc/rc2.d/S99test-service
#   /etc/rc0.d/K01test-service
#   /etc/rcS.d/K01test-service
#   /etc/rc6.d/K01test-service
#
#[service]
#name = example-service
#details = 2:S99 0:K01 6:K01

#[service]
#name = slapd
#details = 2:S99 0:K01 S:K01 6:K01
#depends = slapd /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

# 
#   The "bundles" sections (only one is really necessary) allow you to
#   include chunks of definition files, which are typically bundles of
#   related configuration elements.  
#
#   For example, you might have a bundle that includes all of the
#   packages and files necessary for your site's postfix mail client
#   configuration.
#
#   Details:
#
#       * Simply list the filename for each bundle in your bundles
#         section.
#       * Bundle file names may be relative to the "base_uri", or they
#         may be full URIs of type file://, ftp://, http://, or
#         https://.
#       * A bundle can included any non-global configuration elements.

# [packages] sections
#
# If no packages are specified, no package related actions will be taken.
#
# Details:
#   * Simply list the desired package names, one per line.  
#   * If you list any packages, list all packages for the system.
#   * You can have as many packages sections as you like.
#   * A package section is terminated with a blank line.
#   * A package may be listed more than once.
#
# Package options:
#   * Per-package options are optional, and are specified after the
#     package name following a space: pkgname option
#   * Multiple options are separated by commas: pkgname option1,option2
#   * Available options:
#       * unwanted 
#           Remove this package
#       * priority=INTEGER 
#           Change the priority of the action to be taken on this 
#           package
#   * Example: 
#       #
#       # In this example, we want to remove sudo and use sudo-ldap
#       # instead.  Note that the removal of the sudo package is
#       # completely independent from the adding of the sudo-ldap 
#       # package.  The priority of the sudo package is only competing
#       # against the priority of the sudo package specified elsewhere.
#       #
#       [packages]
#       sudo unwanted,priority=99
#       sudo-ldap
#
# Priority details:
#   * A priority of 0 is assumed if no priority is specified.
#   * If a priority is specified, highest priority wins.
#   * Priority must be an integer (positive or negative).
#   * A conflict occurs when a package is specified more than once at 
#     the same priority but with different options or settings.
#     Therefore, a conflict does _not_ occur if a package is specified
#     more than once, but at the same priority and with the same 
#     options.
#
# Additional yum specific details:
#   * Because of Red Hat's b0rken way of handling architecture, you can
#     have a packages with the same name, but a different arch,
#     installed at the same time.  Ie.: aspell.i386 and aspell.x86_64.
#     Therefore, you should include the arch in the package name in your
#     [packages] sections.
#
# Here is an example packages list from an Ubuntu system:
#

#abcde
#acl
#acpi-support
