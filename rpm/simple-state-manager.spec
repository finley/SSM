%description
Simple State Manager (ssm) allows you to define a desired state for
one or more machines.  This state can include:
* a complete list of packages to be installed (optional)
* version information for some or all packages (optional)
* files that should be in place, and appropriate attributes (optional)
  * regular files (content via md5sum)
  * character, block, and fifo files
  * permissions and ownership
  * soft links and hard links
  * unwanted files and directories (that should be removed)
.
If an defined element of a system is not in the desired state, the
ssm client can fix it, always prompting you before taking action.
Prompting can be suppressed with a --yes option.
.  
State information for a machine is kept in a state definition file,
which can be stored in a location that the ssm client can access via
http:, https:, ftp:, or on the local filesystem.  State definition
files are simple to create, and are easy to read and understand.

  based on the $arguments variable (ie.: 'yn')

  by variablizing tmp files when implied.
- Further standardize output.  Common output strings emitted by

* Tue Dec 01 2009 - brian@thefinleys.com

  maintain permissions and ownership on the directory, just like a
  simple "type = directory".  Plus, any contents of this directory that
  are not defined (elsewhere in the configuration) will be marked as
  unwanted.
- Turn double slashes into single slashes so that tests for conflicting
  host names work properly.
- Turn directories specified with an ending slash into no ending slash
  to ensure conflicting directory names are treated properly.
* Mon Nov 16 2009 - brian@thefinleys.com
- Add a couple of debug entries.
- In the _add_file() function, Allow SVN to just cache the password --
  things break otherwise, but unlink the cache file after the SVN
  operation section.  Only unlinks the cache file for the ANL SVN
  server.
* Mon Nov 16 2009 - brian@thefinleys.com
- Added diff_ownership_and_permissions() function.
- When "Need to fix ownership and permissions" is displayed, also show
  the existing and target permissions for the file.
- When doing a "diff", also diff_ownership_and_permissions().
- Fix a couple of places where svn was being called without the
  --no-auth-cache option.  All svn calls should now be made using the
   $svn variable. SVN v1.6 will allow for secure on-disk caching of the
   password.  At that point, we can consider removal of this option.
- Added show_diff_comments() function.
  * Only do for relevant file types (!generated)
- Added a "c" for "comments" option to [N/y/d/a].  It now looks like
  [N/y/d/c/a] for regular files.

  both.
- Fix bug where --only-files or --only-file failed to find a satisfied
  dependency on a package.
- Added 'generated' file type
- Example file: Added 'generated' file type example
- diff_file():  Added ability to pass two files to this subroutine
